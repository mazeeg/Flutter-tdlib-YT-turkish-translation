00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:06,100
Assalamu alaikum, today we will start the integration of Telegram's TDLib database into Flutter.

2
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:13,340
This includes the official one, TDLib, Kalibrium, Telegram's...

3
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:21,380
...official alternative options. TDLib, the other developers' plus Kalibrium.

4
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:24,920
All of these use Flutter's database.

5
00:00:25,965 --> 00:00:29,025
Now, flat doesn't work, we'll use Telegram's database files. Telegram's...

6
00:00:29,025 --> 00:00:32,465
...is open source, so we can use their files.

7
00:00:33,045 --> 00:00:36,665
We need the necessary tools first. There are 3-4 links, all of them...

8
00:00:37,305 --> 00:00:39,005
...will be below the video, I'll show them.

9
00:00:39,685 --> 00:00:45,785
First, we start by getting the Telegram **API ID** and **App ID** from **my.telegram.org**.

10
00:00:45,785 --> 00:00:50,380
Log into your account, then go to the necessary steps for development.

11
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:55,400
You enter your phone number. After you've entered it, it will ask for a code. That code...

12
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:59,300
...will be sent to you. You enter the code that came to you. There are two steps.

13
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:03,420
The first time you enter, you just log into your account. The next one is...

14
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:09,730
...creating an application. It asks for a code again. Okay, it's not difficult, friends.

15
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:15,050
Okay, let's look at the page. You will see something like "**Create your application**".

16
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:19,190
What do you write on the page? You write the **App Title**. For example, you write its name...

17
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:22,510
...for what it is. You write the name. Flutter, Telegram, I don't know.

18
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:25,430
**Short name**, **URL** are not mandatory.

19
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:27,190
You write the **Short name** and **URL**.

20
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:32,395
You write the name. For Android, you might choose an appropriate package name now...

21
00:01:32,395 --> 00:01:35,955
...and later a **Description**. This **Application** is essentially...

22
00:01:35,955 --> 00:01:37,695
...what you write about the application.

23
00:01:37,875 --> 00:01:39,895
Then you click **Create Application**, and you're done.

24
00:01:40,035 --> 00:01:44,255
I won't create it now because later it will be... I will have to delete the IDs...

25
00:01:44,255 --> 00:01:47,895
...which might be difficult. I might have to go through a lot to delete them...

26
00:01:47,895 --> 00:01:51,695
...or remove them. It's not difficult, you can create it yourself.

27
00:01:51,695 --> 00:01:55,355
After you create it, it will show you your **API ID** and **API Hash**...

28
00:01:55,355 --> 00:01:57,835
...these credentials.

29
00:01:57,835 --> 00:02:03,855
Take them and save them somewhere for the next step, which I will show you.

30
00:02:03,855 --> 00:02:08,195
Next up, we need to download the whole **TDLib**. Next, we look at the link.

31
00:02:08,195 --> 00:02:13,975
This link is for Telegram's database, and where Telegram's new features...

32
00:02:13,975 --> 00:02:17,675
...new features, new functions are added and released.

33
00:02:17,675 --> 00:02:21,475
Let's look at the page. For Windows and MacOS... I will create a Telegram application for Windows and MacOS...

34
00:02:21,475 --> 00:02:24,475
...on this platform soon.

35
00:02:24,975 --> 00:02:28,215
I won't look at the latest Android version now. I'll look at the Android...

36
00:02:28,215 --> 00:02:29,875
...version around the middle.

37
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:38,120
You download the whole **zip** file. Okay, it didn't log me in yet.

38
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:42,170
Here.

39
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:47,620
It's logged in. After logging in, you click on **Libs**. You download those **Libs**.

40
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:53,459
Download them. Here, we've downloaded it. Now...

41
00:02:57,570 --> 00:03:03,510
After we've downloaded it, everything is in a folder. I've measured the time.

42
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:07,329
I'll open the zip file that I downloaded earlier.

43
00:03:07,329 --> 00:03:12,050
Inside, we see a folder called **libs**. We need to put those **libs** into our project...

44
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:13,870
...in the correct place.

45
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,820
We put those **libs** into our project. The project name doesn't matter.

46
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:24,260
You will create a project there using **flutter create**.

47
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:29,700
You have a **Flutter Create** project. You go into that project.

48
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:34,780
When you look, the folder that opens is the **Android** folder.

49
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:37,869
Inside the **Android** folder, we look for the **app** folder.

50
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:44,690
Inside the **app** folder, we look for **src** (**source**). Inside **src**, we see the **main** folder.

51
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:50,929
Now we copy the **libs** that we downloaded and put them into the **main** folder.

52
00:03:52,915 --> 00:03:59,355
Let's see, it's there. Now we'll open it from **VS Code** and continue.

53
00:04:02,095 --> 00:04:07,255
When we open it from **VS Code**, we go into the **android** folder, then the **app** folder, then the **src** folder.

54
00:04:07,255 --> 00:04:11,575
Here we have the **Libs** folder. Now we need to correctly add it...

55
00:04:11,575 --> 00:04:13,135
...put it in, and configure it.

56
00:04:13,135 --> 00:04:18,024
For this, let's look at the **app** folder. Inside the **app** folder, we go to **build.gradle**.

57
00:04:18,024 --> 00:04:22,084
We need to find the **SourceSets** block.

58
00:04:22,084 --> 00:04:30,784
That **SourceSet**...

59
00:04:43,085 --> 00:04:47,255
...then we name it **libs** below.

60
00:04:47,335 --> 00:04:53,955
`libs.sourceDirectories` is what's used for this purpose.

61
00:04:53,955 --> 00:04:55,615
We put it as `source`.

62
00:04:55,815 --> 00:05:02,615
The syntax shouldn't have an error. So we set it as `source.main.libs`.

63
00:05:02,615 --> 00:05:07,475
Look, this **libs** is related to the name.

64
00:05:07,475 --> 00:05:10,115
If your folder is named something else, you need to use that name here.

65
00:05:10,975 --> 00:05:11,655
Okay.

66
00:05:15,585 --> 00:05:20,745
I've said the necessary things about the version. Okay, now for the next step.

67
00:05:20,745 --> 00:05:26,044
We've done everything. Now we need to connect to your repository.

68
00:05:26,044 --> 00:05:30,724
Your repository is on **GitHub**, and the link will be under the video.

69
00:05:30,724 --> 00:05:38,375
Go there. When we go for the machine, we'll see that...

70
00:05:38,375 --> 00:05:43,974
We see the package, I'll copy it. I copy it and go into **pubspec.yaml**...

71
00:05:43,974 --> 00:05:48,659
...of our project. We go into **pubspec.yaml** and open it like this.

72
00:05:48,659 --> 00:05:51,760
You copy and paste it into the code. I'll just write it for now for time...

73
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:55,860
...reasons. You'll see the same thing. You copy that.

74
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:59,960
You write it as **tdlib**. You give the URL of the **Git** repository.

75
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:05,620
You give the URL that you got from **Git** and set the reference to **master**.

76
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:08,340
That is, this is **main**, we know it's from the first one.

77
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:16,055
It's from **master**. We'll stop at this point. The first step is complete.

78
00:06:16,055 --> 00:06:19,655
That is, the integration part is complete.

79
00:06:19,655 --> 00:06:20,540
Now we'll only start coding.
```
